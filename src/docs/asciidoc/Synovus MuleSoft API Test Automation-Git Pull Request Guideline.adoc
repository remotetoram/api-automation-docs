The purpose of this document is to help an individual to understand that how to work as test development in test automation.#


1. Clone repository

If creating MuleSoft API Test automation first time, clone existing repository from Azure Devops.

============================================
git clone https://SynovusFinancial@dev.azure.com/SynovusFinancial/Integration%20Hub/_git/mulesoft-api-test-automation
============================================

2: In MuleSoft API Test Automation , we have to follow branch name as user story number followed by API.

   Example- if task number is 255481 then branch name should be API255281.

3: Always create a new branch from main

=====================================================================
   Command
     1- git checkout main
     2- git checkout -b new-branch name
=====================================================================     
     The above git checkout command accepts a -b argument that acts as a convenience method which will create the new branch and immediately switch to it.


4: After creating new branch from main, we will start coding according to the userstory provided.

   Follow: CodingGuidelines.adoc

5: Steps to push code to AzureDevOps

   * Add changes in local repository
   * Commit the changes
   * Push changes in remote repository

Now itâ€™s time to commit the changes and prepare it for the remote repository so we can push it.
